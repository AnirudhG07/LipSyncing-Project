# Welcome to LipSyncing 1.0 README 
<br>This Branch represents the first attempt of Lipsyncing with given text.

There presents codes which have different functions. Here i used METAPHONE library to create some primitive level of Phonetics. <br>

First is LS_metaphone(LS stands for LipSyncing), presents basic level of function development which provides changes for of word which is suitable for lip mimicry
and presents images one after other at fast speed(which can be controlled).
<br>
I also tried to use this function behind an audio file by finding timestamps using AssemblyAI(Thanks!). Although due to computer processing time and presentation time, 
errors were present in projected images time w.r.t. the audio file. (HELP NEEDED if you can fix it)

<br>I also tried gtts, pygame to give sound behind text, although this didn't work as sound and images were outputted at different times.

But NEW AND IMPROVED VERSION HAS BEEN presented in main branch which works very finely! And deals with all such problems.
